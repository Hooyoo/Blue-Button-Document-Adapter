/**
 * Composite processor interface. Use Composed Message Processor to process a
 * composite message. The Composed Message Processor splits the message up,
 * routes the sub-messages to the appropriate destinations and re-aggregates the
 * responses back into a single message. The Composed Message Processor uses an
 * Aggregator to reconcile the requests that were dispatched to the multiple
 * inventory systems. Each processing unit sends a response message to the
 * aggregator stating the inventory on hand for the specified item. The
 * Aggregator collects the individual responses and processes them based on a
 * predefined algorithm as described under Aggregator.
