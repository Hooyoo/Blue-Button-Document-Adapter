This public domain code has been released through FOIA by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs, and is currently in active development.

The code is designed to interface the NwHIN Adapter within VA to My HealtheVet, the web-based Personal Health Record.  Through modifications to the MHV front end, the code then permits system users to download their XML-based health records.
